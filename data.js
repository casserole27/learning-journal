            I love movies. I especially love science fiction movies. When I was a kid, 
            I wanted to be Luke Skywalker. When I grew up a little, I dreamed of working 
            for Industrial Light and Magic creating special effects for movies. With this first attempt at CSS art, 
            I can be a small part of that magic.

        Flex-wrap and flex-basis/grow/shrink and the flex shorthand property were all new to me. 
        When I saw how to use these properties to make a flexbox image grid, 
        I had to try it immediately! So, I made this small spring image gallery.

        step away from them and come back, and then ask for help. 
        At one point I was able to solve an ongoing problem in five minutes 
        just by giving it a day-long break!

        I learned more about HTML number inputs, and UX / accessibility is enhanced by 
        CSS pseudo-classes :hover, :focus, and :active. I was able to refactor the 
        JS get to get rid of some repetitive lines and make it DRYer. I also presented this project 
        in a bootcamp session to get more comfortable talking about code.

        By completing the stretch goals on this project,
        I learned a TON about input fields and forms, and how they work with

        I love about the Scrimba bootcamp is we get code reviews,

        and see how I can make it better.
