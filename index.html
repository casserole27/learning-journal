                    This past January, I joined the Scrimba Frontend 
                    Development bootcamp and carrer path to get expert
                    code reviews of my Solo Projects and meet like-minded peers. 
                    I also began building in public on 
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clewisdev/">LinkedIn</a>,
                    and this site features my project walk-thru videos.

                        This was a great exercise in manipulating user input data, 
                        converting it to an array of objects, 
                        and then rendering and manipulating that data. 
                        I also added some UX enhancements to direct users 
                        if they enter an invalid entry: blank inputs, 
                        duplicate tasks, and entering tasks without a price.

                        I love movies. I especially love science fiction movies. When I was a kid, 
                        I wanted to be Luke Skywalker. When I grew up a little, I dreamed of working 
                        for Industrial Light and Magic creating special effects for movies. maybe
                        with this first attempt at CSS art, I could be a small part of that magic.

                        For the group project I'm working on, 
                        I made a clickable star rating using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. 
                        I am concerned about icon usage and #accessibility, 
                        so I also started studying how to make the usage of icons more accessible.

                        Flex-wrap and flex-basis/grow/shrink and the flex shorthand property were all new to me. 
                        When I saw how to use these properties to make a flexbox image grid, 
                        I had to try it immediately. So, I made this little spring image gallery.

                        I did a whole lot of failing at JavaScript. 
                        My biggest takeaway from this is to set time limits on problems, 
                        step away from them and come back, and then ask for help. 
                        At one point I was able to solve an ongoing problem in five minutes

                        I learned more about HTML number inputs, UX / accessibility is enhanced by 
                        CSS pseudo-classes :hover, :focus, and :active. I was able to refactor the 
                        JS get rid of some repetitive lines. I also presented this project 
                        in a bootcamp session to get more comfortable talking about code.

                        I'm satisfied with this layout and color palette, 
                        and I added some :hovers here and there to highlight the buttons. 
                        It is nicely responsive between desktop and mobile. 
                        I completed a small dropdown menu in JS to hide the scoring rules 
                        because I want this to be as compact on the screens as possible.

                        There might be some spaghetti code in there but I'm so glad I did this 
                        because I learned a TON about input fields and forms, and how they work with 
                        HTML, CSS, and Javascript combined. And... it works! One of the things 
                        I love about the Scrimba bootcamp is we get code reviews, 
                        so I'm very interested to see how this turned out, get my questions answered, 
                        and see how I can make it better.
