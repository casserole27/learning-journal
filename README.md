## My process

- Create Github repository
- Set up basic HTML file 
- Set up basic CSS file
- Set up basic JavaScript file
- Consult Figma design files
- Project work
- Publish live URL
- Check markup and accessibility
(https://validator.w3.org/)
(https://wave.webaim.org/)
- README file

### Built with

- semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Responsive Web Design and Media Queries
- CSS flexbox
- CSS grid
- vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- I attempted to build on WordPress.org with my existing HTML and CSS
  - On the index page, I tried to apply all of the HTML file using the classic editor
  - On the about page, I added HTML with various blocks
  - I added CSS through customize
  - It is difficult to overwrite them headers, footers, menus, etc if you want to use your own
  - I used chatGPT to walk me through adding JS to WP, which involves adding your JS file to the directory and a PHP file

### UI/UX and Accessibility

- I learned that my walk-through videos would not portray my projects to all users, especially those with visual impairments
  - the way it is structured, there are no captions or anything that can be pulled into a transcript
- Accessibility for videos is a bit more complicated than adding an alt image tag.
  - It is better to add a more accessible player to your code rather than the default HTML player

### Continued development

- I would like to be able to add additional posts by rendering in JavaScript, at least on the scratch site, either using a data file or Classes.
- I would like to learn more about site optimization, my hero image and videos take a while to load.
