                    <p class="learn-description">
                        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. 
                        I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try 
                        to create simple projects using what I learned or 
                        work new techniques into existing projects.

                    <p class="learn-description">
                        While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to 
                        share what I was learning and most things about my journey with 
                        the world.

                    <h3 class="learn-title">How I got started</h3>

                    <p class="learn-description">
                        I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. 
                        I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, 
                        I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short 
                        summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                    
                    <p class="learn-description">    
                        That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my 
                        learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
