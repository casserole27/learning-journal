                    <h3>How I stay committed to learning.</h3>

                    <p>
                        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. 
                        I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try 
                        to create simple projects using what I learned or 
                        work new techniques into existing projects.
                    </p>    
                        
                    <p>
                        While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How I got started</h3>

                    <p>
                        I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. 
                        I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, 
                        I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short 
                        summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                    
                    <p>    
                        That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my 
                        learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
